# e-waste-generation-classification-EDUNET
E-Waste Generation classification software using architectures like efficient net. AICTE(EDUNET) Internship

## üîç Project Summary
We are using **EfficientNetV2B0** (a transfer learning model) to classify different types of e-waste images such as mobile phones, laptops, and other electronic waste. We will also try to use other transfer training models and architecture to make the model lightweight. By the end of the completion we can also deploy it, add a further module inside it, compare it with some other architecture and give better accuracy, etc.
